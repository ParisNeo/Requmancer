# Requmancer
Requmancer is a powerful Python library and command-line tool that analyzes your Python project and generates a comprehensive requirements file. It automatically detects imported packages, determines their versions, and creates either a pip-compatible requirements.txt or a Poetry-style pyproject.toml section.
